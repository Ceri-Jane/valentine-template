## 🖼️ Add Your Photos

1. Put your images in: `assets/images/photos/`
2. Name them: `01.jpg`, `02.jpg`, `03.jpg`, etc. (two digits)
3. Update the number of photos in `assets/js/app.js`:
   - `const PHOTO_COUNT = 12;`  ← change this to match your photos
4. Supported extensions: **jpg / jpeg / png / webp**  
   If you're mixing extensions, set `const PHOTO_EXT = "jpg";` to match.

## 🔘 Button Behaviour (Desktop vs Mobile)

This project intentionally changes how the **"No"** button behaves depending on the device.  
It creates a playful, teasing interaction while still working naturally on touchscreens.

All behaviour is handled in:

```
assets/js/app.js
```

The script automatically detects whether the device has a mouse or touch input:

```js
window.matchMedia("(pointer: coarse)").matches
```
---

### 🖥️ <u>Desktop (mouse / trackpad)</u>

On devices with a **cursor**:

- The **No** button actively avoids being clicked
- When the cursor gets close:
  - it instantly disappears
  - a playful toast message appears
- It only reappears once the cursor moves away

Result:

- The button feels “uncatchable”
- The user naturally ends up clicking **Yes**
- Creates a fun, cheeky interaction

---

### 📱 <u>Mobile / Touch devices</u>

Touchscreens don’t support hover, so the behaviour changes to a tap-based system.

Instead of dodging:

- The **No** button can be tapped
- Each tap:
  - briefly hides the button
  - shows a teasing message
- After **4 taps**:
  - the button permanently transforms into **Yes**
  - it behaves exactly like the original Yes button
  - tapping it proceeds to the next page

Flow:

```
Tap 1 → disappears
Tap 2 → disappears
Tap 3 → disappears
Tap 4 → becomes YES
```

Result:

- Works naturally on touch devices
- Still playful
- Eventually leaves only “Yes” as the option 😄

---

### ✏️ <u>Customising the behaviour (optional)</u>

Inside `assets/js/app.js` you can tweak:

```js
const MAX_NO_TAPS = 4;      // number of taps before converting to Yes
const DISAPPEAR_MS = 650;  // how long the button hides (milliseconds)
```

- consistent across devices
- and fully static (no backend required)

## 📝 Notes

- The "gate" is stored in `localStorage` under `valentineAccepted`.
- Pages with `data-guard="true"` require the gate to be accepted.
- The gallery carousel is generated by JS (no 40-line HTML carousel needed).
